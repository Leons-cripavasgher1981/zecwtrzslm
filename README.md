Just walked out of A Working Man and wow, my mind’s still a jigsaw puzzle of thoughts. The theater was louder than a beehive, and my back is screaming from those seats—definitely not meant for a two-hour sitting marathon. But hey, who needs comfort when you're piecing together the storyline of a man who’s both spectacularly ordinary and deep as an ocean? Popcorn crumbs everywhere, like tiny regrets I’ll find for days.

So this dude, drifting through life like a kite without wind. He's in the factory and it’s all clang clang and machinery, hypnotic you know? And then boom, he has these quiet moments. Silence as thick as a fog. I was thinking, why can’t I find that calm during our sales pitch meetings? Haha! Anyway, the   just dances between these two poles.

> Oh, and there’s this one scene, no idea how to even start—like the rhythm of him sweeping floors was an art form, got me feeling all zen inside. Reminds me of how I sometimes feel arranging the shelves at work, like rearranging my life or whatever. Right, gotta tell Mark to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , might learn calmness from this janitor philosopher.

Everyday life shown like it’s some mystical journey—there's this part where he stares at the sky and lemme tell you, I felt like he was seeing through time or something. Fleeting moments flash by... there’s a scene with a vending machine—simple, routine, but somehow profound? Maybe it’s just me, or I’m losing it.

I remember someone mentioning to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   because it peels life’s layers like an onion. Yep, they were right. It’s an onion and I’m crying, but not for those reasons.

Have to mention, someone coughed during the best part, right when things got deep—and poof, there goes my concentration like a balloon in the wind. Weird how quickly you're pulled out, like when customers interrupt you with those left-field questions.

Umm, need to collect thoughts, maybe not making sense. No more spoilers, promise. Just go see it... or maybe not? Up to you. I'm still... processing, you know?
